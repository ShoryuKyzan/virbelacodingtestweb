# How to run

Set up a docker environment.

## Production

* This was designed to run on one machine inside a docker engine.
* ```npm run start``` will start docker-compose for the yaml file in the main directory.
* To rebuild quickly, use ./update.sh
* Will run api on port 8000
* To shut down, run ```npm run stop```

## Development

* Run ```npm install -g ts-node```
* Run ```npm install -g nodemon```
* Run ```npm install```
* ```cd src/```
* Run ```nodemon main.js```
* Will run an API server on port 8000, and it will refresh automatically when code changes are made
